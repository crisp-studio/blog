### Who is Mister Spex?

Eleven years ago, Mister Spex disrupted the traditional optics industry by launching an online platform. Now, with over three million customers and, on average, up to 15,000 orders per day, the company has become the most successful online optician in Europe. In addition to their online activities, the Mister Spex team also operates physical stores at prime locations, while expanding its network of partner opticians. Due to its multichannel sales concept, it's one of the pioneers in the field of online marketing for optical products.
