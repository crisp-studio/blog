# Who is Mister Spex?

Eleven years ago, Mister Spex disrupted the traditional optics industry by launching an online platform. Now, with over three million customers and, on average, up to 15,000 orders per day, the company has become the most successful online optician in Europe. In addition to their online activities, the Mister Spex team also operates physical stores at prime locations, while expanding its network of partner opticians. Due to its multichannel sales concept, it's one of the pioneers in the field of online marketing for optical products.

# The Challenge

The company offers more than 10,000 frames from more than 100 brand names. That's a huge benefit when it comes to having the right glasses for their customers. But due to the wide selection of glasses finding the right glasses can also last a while and may even get overwhelming. So the Sprint was laid out to tackle on how to help customers finding the right glasses faster. Well, challenge accepted.

# The Sprint Team

To tackle the challenge we were a great interdisciplinary Sprint Team:

* Product Manager
* UX Designer
* Front-End Developer
* Multichannel PM
* Retail Staff Training Lead

They blocked the first three of the five days of the Sprint to go from the challenge to a promising solution.

# What Crisp Studio did

To ensure the overall success of the Sprint and the focus on the challenge Crisp Studio organized and facilitated the whole sprint week making sure the exercises were understood and done in time. In order to ensure tangible validation results, we were responsible for the design and development of a high fidelity prototype. For the validation of the prototype, we made sure to recruit matching user testers and conducted the user tests on the last day of the sprint week.

# Recap of the week

### Monday

On Monday we went through different exercises to find the key challenges of the project that we should tackle first with the goal of getting the ball rolling, building momentum, and creating a foundation for the project to continue on with.

To align the team's knowledge on the challenge we were joined by outside experts such as a UX Researcher and a Store Manager of one of Mister Spex's physical stores. They helped us get further insights into the existing online and offline customers of Mister Spex. 

At the end of the day, we had lots of Post-its, a target on the customer journey, a 2-year goal and critical Sprint questions that we wanted to answer with the Sprint.

**The 2 Year Goal:**  

> In two years time, our users feel the same amount of security when buying online as when buying in the store

**Sprint Question:**  

> Can we display the advantages of offline face-to-face consultation online?
>
> Can we design the online purchase in such a way that the customer can make a safe purchase decision?
>
> Can we simulate the haptic sensation online?

### Tuesday

On Tuesday we reflected the Sprint goal we formulated to take action on the challenge and looked at great solutions from a range of companies in different industries.

On the afternoon we relied on the Sprint principle _"Together Alone"_ and individually created several potential solutions to our challenge. Doing exercises together, but without any communication with each other, allows for everyone to have their idea voiced and express their unique perspective. Each of us started with rough concepts and we ended with seven tangible concepts.

### Wednesday

On ​Wednesday​ we spent time reviewing and voting on the concept solutions we all created and made decisions on which ideas and concepts we want to experiment with to solve our challenge. 

The winning concept was called _"Hot or Not"_ and suggested combining an individual quiz with 3D try-on to make sure customers have a reduced selection of matching glasses relevant to them.

In the afternoon we created a detailed storyboard for the prototype displaying every screen we wanted to test with the test users on Friday.

### Thursday

On ​Thursday​ the prototyping team bent time and space to create a high fidelity prototype. There was just one issue: High fidelity meant including 3D technology to assure usable feedback from the test users. So we had to reach into the bag of tricks and get active on the programming side. Later on, the connection of design and code made sure that users had a real 3D experience during the tests.

### Friday

On ​Friday​, we tested the prototype with five potential customers. Interviews were held all day long and every interviewee delivered lots of valuable feedback to the solution created. The Feedback and the happenings of the week were then compressed into an executive summary for stakeholders.
